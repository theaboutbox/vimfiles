== vimfiles

These are my VIM files. I've tried to keep it simple to install the plugins and keep them up to date.  There are probably sets of files that are more complete or better customized. These are just here so I can build a vim config from scratch.

== Usage

    git clone . . . .vim
    cd .vim
    ruby setup.rb

This will go and download and install all of the plugins

== Plugins

* Pathogen  - for easy plugin management
* NERDTREE  - for navigation [https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree]
* Rails.vim - for handy rails development [https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails] 

== Common Commands

* `:NERDTree` - Opens pane with tree in it
* `<ctrl-p>` - Opens fuzzy finder window
